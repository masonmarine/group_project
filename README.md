This repository serves as a collaborative environment for the group members listed above who are enrolled in Duke University's Spring 2025 Environmental 710 statistics course. It is used to showcase members' statistical models that were used in the analysis of species dynamics in Northern California kelp forests. The data was sourced from Partnership of Interdisciplinary Studies for Coastal Oceans (PISCO) that perform surveys for kelp forest ecosystems through scuba diving transects. PISCO is a collaboration between government agencies and various academic institutions to survey coastal habitats, and in California, trains scientific divers from University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) and University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) to conduct underwater roving surveys. PISCOâ€™s data that spans from 1999 to 2019 is publicly available on the DataONE website (<doi:10.6085/AA/PISCO_kelpforest.1.6>) and we utilized the swath, site and taxon data for our analysis. For the purpose of our analysis we used data sourced only from UCSC that focused on Northern California kelp forests.
