library(tidyverse)

# Load in data
kelp_data <- read_csv("PISCO_kelpforest_swath.1.2.csv")
```
### Tidy Data
```{r}
kelp_disease_data <- kelp_data %>% 
  filter(disease %in% c("SEVERE", "MILD", "YES", "WASTING", "BLACK SPOT"))
```

### Figure
```{r}
# Create a histogram of red urchin size distributions
kelp_disease_plot <- ggplot(kelp_disease_data,
                            aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(stat = "count",
            size = 1) +  # Count occurrences per year
  geom_point(stat = "count",
             size = 2) +  # Add points for better visibility
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Disease Count", 
       color = "Disease",
       caption = "       Figure 2: This figure shows a line graph of disease presence found in California kelp forests and can be used to 
       assess the condition of their health thoughout time.",
       title = "Trends in Disease Occurrences Across Years") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5))
